    "# Create a Quine Icon Library with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wanted to add flair to a graph visualization but are unsure which icons Quine supports? In this blog, we explore a Python script that fetches valid icon names from the web, configures the Exploration UI, then creates a graph of icon nodes for reference. The script uses several popular Python libraries, including Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Halo, along with the `/query-ui` and `/query/cypher` API endpoints.\n",
